Start by choosing the right plant for your environmentâ€”some plants prefer low light, while others need bright, indirect sunlight. Watering is another crucial factor; overwatering can lead to root rot, so always check the soil moisture before watering. Regularly clean the leaves to keep them dust-free, as this helps them absorb more light. Don't forget to fertilize during the growing season and re-pot when necessary to give their roots room to grow. By following these steps, your indoor plants will remain healthy and vibrant.",
